Welcome to Antinetcut
=====================

This document describes how simply you can use antinetcut to protect yourself against NetCut attacks if you are under Unix/Linux or Mac OS X.

The process is very simply, you first must run those commands as root.

# ./antinetcut.py start

this should start the antinetcut daemon, and you can close the terminal as it's now running in the background.
You can check the status of operation using the log file in /var/log/antinetcut.log
